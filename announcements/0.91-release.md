shelldoc 0.91 is out!

This second release candidate focuses on code quality and testing. The
test suite now covers CLI commands, the tokenizer, and JUnit XML
output more thoroughly. The codebase has been cleaned up with better
documentation and idiomatic Go patterns.

0.91 is the second of three release candidates on the road to 1.0,
with the final RC expected in two weeks.

What's new:
- Expanded test coverage across all major components
- Added godoc comments to exported functions
- Code cleanup and idiomatic improvements
- Removed incomplete experimental features

Testing and feedback welcome!
