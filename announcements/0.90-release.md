Announcing the relaunch of shelldoc with version 0.90!

I've taken over maintenance of shelldoc again in 2026. shelldoc tests Unix shell commands in your Markdown documentation, ensuring your examples stay accurate and up-to-date.

shelldoc is ready for use today. 0.90 is the first of three release candidates on the road to 1.0, with bi-weekly releases until stable. This version brings bug fixes, security improvements, modernization to Go 1.21, and GitHub Actions CI with visual test reports.

Testing and experimentation encouraged! Feedback and pull requests welcome.

Install: `go install github.com/mirkoboehm/shelldoc/cmd/shelldoc@v0.90`
